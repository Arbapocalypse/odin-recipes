            <p>On average, a cold brew will set you back at least ₱100. But with a bit of patience and the necessary equipment, the same amount (or less, depending on how much you buy your coffee beans or grounds for) could go a much longer way.</p>
            <p>If you’re not new to cold brew, you know very well by now that it isn’t synonymous to a chilled cup of brewed coffee. Brewing takes 12 to 24 hours, and this makes coffee stronger and less acidic. Once you’ve mastered the simple art of making your own cold brew, we guarantee you’ll be saying <em>“Starbucks who?”</em> Seriously, this is one of the coffee recipes I recommend mastering — because it serves as an excellent base for countless others!</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup coarsely ground coffee</li>
                <li>4 cups cold or room temperature water</li>
                <p><em>*This recipe makes enough servings to last you several days!</em></p>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place your coffee grounds in a big jar or wide-mouthed bottle.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you have a strainer bag at home, place your grounds inside. It will save you the extra time and effort after your cold brew is ready!</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Add water and stir. Make sure all your grounds are hydrated.</li>
                <li>Cover your container with a lid and place it in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.</li>
                <li>Remove from the refrigerator and filter out your coffee grounds with a strainer. For better filtering, you can place a cheesecloth over your strainer.</li>
                <li>Voila! You have your cold brew concentrate. Depending on how strong you like your coffee, you can enjoy it on its own, or dilute with water as needed. Serve with ice!</li>
            </ol>
