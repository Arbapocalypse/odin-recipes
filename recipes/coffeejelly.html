        <p>The mere thought of coffee jelly takes me back to my childhood. We’d make coffee jelly to top our vanilla ice cream on hot afternoons; and during the rare times my parents would allow me to have a bit of caffeine, I’d take a sip of my dad’s coffee jelly drink from Starbucks. I just loved its subtle flavour and chewy texture!</p>
        <p>Years later, my colleagues and I would end our lunch breaks by grabbing coffee jelly from our office’s in-house restaurant. It easily became one of my favourite desserts: coffee jelly mixed with a generous amount of sweetened cream. With the following coffee jelly recipe from Kawaling Pinoy, you can enjoy yours the way you prefer: in your coffee, with ice cream, or with sweetened cream! Don’t you just love versatile coffee recipes?</p>
